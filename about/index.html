	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a Noida (UP, India) resident and I have done my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering. I have 2.5 years of experience working in JavaScript as a Software Engineer in a reputed Software/IT Company. 
           I am an avid reader of technology related articles and interested in advancing my knowledge and experience in Web Development. I did an Ethical Hacking as 
           well as Robotics course in high school to indulge my interest in the fields, which gave me quite an interesting gist of the domains and in hindsight about Engineering.
