<div class="about">
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a New Delhi resident and it's my last year at Amity School of Engineering & Technology as
         a Computer Science and Engineering Undergrad. I am learning Python & JavaScript among other things in my free time.
         I like Machine Learning and have made a small ML project in summer of 2018. I am an avid reader of technology related articles 
         and interested in advancing my knowledge and experience in Web Development. I did an Ethical Hacking as well as Robotics course 
         in high school for my interest in the fields, which gave me quite an interesting gist of the domains.
